#### Lint

- Run lint: `yarn lint`
- Fix lint issue: `yarn lint --fix`

#### Audit

- Run `yarn audit` for package security vulnerabilities
- Recommend fixing/updating any package with _direct_ dependencies
- If vulnerabilities found in transitive dependency, but it has yet to resolve, then list them in `package.json > resolutions` node as [Selective Dependency Resolutions condition explained here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/).

#### Husky & Git

> NOTE: [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) üêï will guard and enforce static code analysis such as `lint` and any security `audit` via pre-commit hook. You are encourage to fix those. If you wish to skip this for good reason, you can by-pass husky by using [`--no-verify`](https://github.com/typicode/husky/issues/124) flag in `git` command.

- The default branch is `dev`. Any merges are CI/CD to `DEV` account environment.
- The `main` branch is production. Any merges are CI/CD to `PROD` account environment.
- Merge to `main` should be fast-forward merge from `dev` to maintain sync and linearity as follows:

git push origin main
```
